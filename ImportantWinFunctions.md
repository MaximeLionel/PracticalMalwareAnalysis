| Name | Use | Indication |
| ---- | ----| ----|
| accept | listen for incoming connections | the program will listen for incoming connections on a socket
| AdjustTokenPrivileges | enable or disable specific access privilege | Malware often call this function to perform process injection and gain additional access.
| AttachThreadInput | Attachs input process for one thread to another so that the 2nd thread receives input events such as keyboard and mouse events | Keyloggers and other spyware often use this.
| bind | associate a local address to a socket | listen to incomming connections
| BitBlt | copy graphic data from one device to another | Spyware sometimes uses this function to capture screenshots. This function is often added by the compiler as part of library code.
| CallNextHookEx | calls next hook in the chain | Used within code that is hooking an event set by SetWindowsHookEx. Help to determine the purpose of a hook set by SetWindowsHookEx. | 
| CertOpenSystemStore | Used to access the certificates stored on the local system |
| CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent | Check if the specific process is being debugged. | Used as part of anti-debugging technique. |
| CoCreateInstance | Create a COM object. | The class identifier (CLSID) will tell which file contains the code that implements the COM object |
| connect | Used to connect to a remote socket. | Malware often uses low-level functionality to connect to a command-and-control server. |
| ConnectNamedPipe | Used to create a server pipe for interprocess communication that will wait for a client pipe to connect. | Backdoors and reverse shells sometimes use ConnectNamedPipe to simplify connectivity to a command-and-control server. |
| ControlService | Used to start, stop, modify or send a signal to a running service. | If Malware is using its own malicious service, you need to analyze the code that implements the service in order to determine the purpose of the call. |
| CreateFile | Create a file or open an existing file. | - |
| CreateFileMapping | Create a handle to a file mapping that loads a file into memory and makes it accessable via memory addresses. | Launchers, loaders and injectors use CreateFileMapping to read and modify PE files. |
| CreateMutex | Create a mutual exclusion object that can be used by Malware to ensure that only a single instance of the malware is running on a system at any given time. | Malware often uses fixed names for mutexes, which can be good host-based indicators to detect additional installations of the malware. |
| CreateProcess | Create and launch a new process. | If Malware creates a new process, you need to analyze the new process as well. |
| CreateRemoteThread | Used to start a thread in a remote process. | Launchers and stealth malware use CreateRemoteThread to inject code into a different process. |
| CreateService | Create a service that can be started at boot time. | Malware uses CreateService for persistence, stealth to load kernel drivers. | 
| CreateToolhelp32Snapshot | Create a snapshot of processes, heaps, threads and modules. | Malware often uses this function to iterates through processes or threads. |
| CryptAcquireContext | Often the first function used by Malware to initialize the use of Windows encryption. | - |
| DeviceIoControl | Send a control message from user space to a device driver. | Malware uses it to pass information between user space and kernel space. |
| DllCanUnloadNow | - | An exported function that indicates that the program implements a COM server. |
| DllGetClassObject | - | An exported function that indicates that the program implements a COM server. |
| DllInstall | - | An exported function that indicates that the program implements a COM server. |
| DllRegisterServer | - | An exported function that indicates that the program implements a COM server. |
| DllUnregisterServer | - | An exported function that indicates that the program implements a COM server. |
| EnableExecuteProtectionSupport | An undocumented API used to modify **Data Execution Protection (DEP)** settings of the host, make it more susceptible to attack. |
| EnumProcesses | Used to enumerate through running processes on the system. | Malware often enumerates through processes to find a process to inject into. |
| EnumProcessModules | Used to **enumerate the loaded modules (exe or dll)** for a given process. | Malware enumerates through modules when doing injection. |
| FindFirstFile/FindNextFile | Used to search through a directory and enumerate the file system. | - |
| FindResource | Used to find a resource in an exe or dll. | Malware sometimes uses resources to store strings, configuration information or other malicious file. If see FindResource, check for .rsrc section in the malware's PE header. |
| FindWindow | Searches for an open window on the desktop. | Sometimes the function is used as an anti-debugging technique to search for OllyDbg windows. |
