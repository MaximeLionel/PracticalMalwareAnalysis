# Source-Level vs. Assembly-Level Debuggers

# Kernel vs. User-Mode Debugging

# Using a Debugger
* 2 ways to debug a program: start program with the debugger, or attach a debugger to a program.
## Single-Stepping
## Single-Over vs Stepping-Into
## Pausing Execution with Breakpoints
### Software Execution Breakpoints - 0xcc
### Hardware Execution Breakpoints - dedicated hardware registers
* can be set on access rather than on execution.
* only 4 hardware registers can store breakpoints addresses.
  * DR0-DR3 store breakpoint addresses.
  * DR7 stores information about whether DR0-DR3 are enabled and whether represent read, write or execution breakpoints.
### Conditional Breakpoints

# Exceptions
* exceptions are the principal way that a debugger gains control of a running program.
* exceptions can also be used to govern the flow of execution in program.
## First and Second Chance Exceptions
* first-chance exception: when an exception occurs while the debugger is attached, the program stops execution and the debugger is given a **first chance** at control.
* second-chance exception: if the program has a registered exception handler, after enter the exception program, the debugger is given another chance to handle. Then the program is crashed.
## Common Exceptions
* the most common exception: INT3.
