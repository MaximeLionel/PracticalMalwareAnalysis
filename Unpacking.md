# Concepts
## Packing
* The compressed file can be run independently, and the decompression process is **completely hidden and all completed in memory**;
* The original program is decrypted and restored during the shell execution.
* Shell types: compressed shells + encypted shells;

## OEP - Original Entry Point
* Software packing generally **hides the real OEP** of the program;
* After running the program self-unpacking module, the execution will **stay at the OEP position** before packing the program. It's the best time to dump the program;

## IAT - Import Address Table
* Most packing software will rebuild IAT;
* Obtaining correct IAT is key to manual unpacking operation;

# Some Unpacking Method
## Single-step tracking method
* Use Ollydbg to single-step the whole self-unpacking process;

## ESP Law
* the principle is stack balance;
* In the proces of self-decryption or self-decompressed, many shells will firstly push the current register content. After decompression or decryption, the previous register values will pop up;

## Memory Mirror Method
* Principle:
    * When shell program is self-decompressing or self-decrypting, it will firstly access the resource segment to obtain the required resources. 
    * Then switch back to program code segment after self-decompressing or self-decrypting is done.
    * At the current position of program, it's easy to reach OEP by single step tracking;

## Reach OEP in one step
* Search for the characteristic assembly code of the shell to achieve one-step breakpoint to OEP;

## The last exception method
* Principle:
    * The program may trigger numerous exceptions duing process of self-decompression or self-decryption;
* Solution:
    * Use OllyDbg exception counter plug-in;
    * Firstly record the number of exceptions, then reload, and automatically stop at the last exception;

## Simulation Tracking Method
* Use conditional breakpoint under Ollydbg;
* SFX is equivalent to a self-extracting method;

# Some Shelling Practices
## UPX shelling
